# Air quality and behavioral health in Allegheny County, PA

Preliminary evidence suggests a link between air quality and behavioral health:
- [Retrospective study in the US and Denmark](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000353)
- [Literature review on the state of the science](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0161813X22001668?via%3Dihub)
- [Another literature review](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10375903/)

These studies hypothesize that increased pollution leads to increased systemic inflammation, which is well known to be correlated with psychopathology.

I am interested to see if these results are observable in publicly available data from Allegheny County, PA.
