# Air quality and health in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania

Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, is my home. This region is remarkable for many reasons, including
- [terrible air quality](https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/dangerous-for-peoples-health-american-lung-association-report-puts-pittsburgh-among-worst-places-for-air-quality/)
- [easily accessible regional data](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/)

I started this project to see what (if any) links between air quality and health outcomes were observable in public data. 

### (Work in progress) Childhood asthma

There is a well understood link between air pollution and childhood asthma. For example:
- [2024 study linking early exposure to PM 2.5 and NO2 with later onset asthma](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2815586)
- [Long term PM 2.5 exposure associated with asthma prevalence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41390-023-02977-5)
- [Meta-analyses of air pollution vs asthma](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7503605/)

In [this notebook](notebooks/WIP%20Asthma%20vs%20PM25.ipynb), I look at the relationship between childhood asthma-related medical encounters and PM 2.5 during 2017.

### (Future work) Behavioral health

Preliminary evidence suggests a link between air quality and behavioral health:
- [Retrospective study in the US and Denmark](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000353)
- [Literature review (2022) on links between air quality and anxiety/depression](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0161813X22001668?via%3Dihub)
- [Literature review (2023)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10375903/)

These studies hypothesize that increased pollution leads to increased systemic inflammation, which is well known to be correlated with psychopathology.

I am interested to see if these results are observable in publicly available data from Allegheny County, PA.
